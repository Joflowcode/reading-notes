Code 102 - Class 02 - Reading Notes
Lecture Notes:

pwd bring back to home
ls  (list directory)
cd (file name) to open that file
mkdir (creates directory aka new folder)
after typing cd you can tab to autocomplete, just type enough letters for the file to be narrowed down to

Create a new file:
touch filename.md
touch (a space) then file name with .md extension because we want markdown file

cd .. (takes back 1 level in file structure) (essential like the back button in file explorer)

the number of dots determine how far to go back. creates a chain. 4 dots .... would press the "back button" 4 times .

In the industry it is important to be familiar with the terminal and not rely only on file explorer because some commands can only be done in the terminal.

code . (opens up vscode). But WHERE you open it in the terminal is where it opens in the text editor vscode. so be careful where you open it at the pwd/user level 
vscode will open up EVERY file in the PC.

So best to go to the folder you want to work in.

VScode has linters (similar to spellcheck), and also real time previews as I code. Nifty that it has an error checker. 
Make sure I understand the suggeted correction before implementing as it may misinterpret what code I intended.
A great resource as it gives an explanation too.

CHOOSING A TEXT EDITOR - THE OLDER CODER - MEDIUM ARTICLE

- every compuyer comes with its own text editor.
Mac - Text Edit
Windows  - Notepad
Linux - each districbution have its own already bu it depends on the particular distribution. in short sounds like many.

ALWAYS MAKE SURE TO BE CODING IN PLAIN TEXT IF USING PRE-INSTALLED TEXT EDITOR.

-also watch your extensions for html, css, and md files.

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TEXT EDITORS AND IDES

- Text editors manage text and files.
IDE (Integrated Development Enviroment) is a software suite. They are a text editor, file manager, compiler, and debugger in one.

Article gives example of MS Outlook. (It does email, calendar, task manager, to do list.)
