# Code 102: Class 4 Reading Notes

## *HTML & CSS* - Jon Duckett

### **Chapter 4: Links**

&lt;&gt;

&lt;a&gt; is the element for links and uses attribute href.

When linking to page in same folder, the href value is the name of the file.

Such as a folder having a page called index.html, page1.htlm and page2.htlm

all that is needed is &lt;a href="page1.html">Page 1&lt;a&gt; to link

To open link in new window, target must be blank

You link to specific part of same page by by giving the element attribute an id then # id name

Best pratice is to use relative links than qualified URLS

### **Chapter 15: Layout**

Nice overview of what discussed in class as well.

> "CSS treats each HTML element as if in own box. It will be either block-level or inline box"

* Block-level elements start on a new line (h1, p, ul, li)

* Inline elements flow in between surrounding text (img, b, i)

* Containing Elements: If one block-level element sits inside another
block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element.

Some CSS positionings are:

* relative
* static
* absolute
* fixed

Code example best reviewed in book as image heavy, showing possible layouts and the dimmensions needed to create.

## *JavaScript* - Jon Duckett

### **Chapter 3: Basic JavaScript Instructions (“Functions, Methods, and Objects” (pp.86-99 ONLY)**

The pages for reading are a basic overview and examples of functions and variables

Functions  group specific statements together to perform a ask.
When the function is called, it is called invoked with ()

To create a function you give it a name and then write the statements needed to achieve its task inside the curly braces.

Notes: I was unsure of pair programming but I am here to exolore every avenue and broaden my horizaons. I think most of the article is correct, but company culture, and synergy with partner is important too. I thin it is a good concept for companies to do and likely prevents fatigue and burnout.

I love collaborating with peers, and even love sharing my work to get feedback. THe fact that companies do pair programming in interviews makes me glad that CodeFellows is training us in this.

I've worked on large Kaizen and lean projects with different teams on shorter term bases and enjoyed them. I can see the benefits of pair programming on strictly programming and some cybersecurity roles. 

But goals in Cybersecurity are risk analyst or incident response type roles (as my current top choices), or security engineer. I think it is good to keep pair programming skills current, but research intensive roles like that I wonder how that would work? Maybe just when deploying some update or patches? Or a company project?


### Things I want to know more about:

Multiple style sheets on same html document (chapter 15)

Is it more common for companies to do full-time pair programming or sometimes?

What tech fields would need it?
