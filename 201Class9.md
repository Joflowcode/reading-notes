# Code 102: Class 2 Reading Notes

## *HTML & CSS* - Jon Duckett

## **Chapter 7: “Forms” (p.144-175)**

Goes over all the types of forms for users to submit input.

* Whenever you want to c XX ollect information from
visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a
form element.

* Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.

* Each form control is given a name, and the text the
user types in or the values of the options they select
are sent to the server.

Also each form must have its own label element


## **Chapter 14: “Lists, Tables & Forms” (pp.330-357)**

* section on table properties. useful for current assignment as reference.

* due to HTML and JS updates, want to research any updated methods available now for lists and forms.



## *JavaScript* - Jon Duckett

### **Chapter 6: “Events” (pp.243-292)**

Amazing chapter. Want to come back and flesh out the notes, but it contains all the things I wanted my pages to do but didn't know how to do them. ES6 events is the key!

.getElementbyID and eventListeners are especially some I want to know more and practice with. Lab 6-8 introduced getting in the habit of them. Definitely make building html pages fun.
