## Lecture Notes:

>Programming Defintion:
list of instructions

>Unless modified, code is run form top to bottom so it si importabt to know how want it to run

>To call a function, you type the function's name followed by parentheses and a semicolon:

>Today really highlighted the important of clearly defining a variable with robot demonstration.

>Control Flow: Unless modified, code is run from top to bottom so it is important to know how you want it to run

>Conditional statements, loops, events, and functions are used to modify the control flow.

>If a function has variables, then it is only aailable inside to the function - it is local to the function

### What is script?

The < script > HTML element is used to embed executable code or data; this is typically used to embed or refer to JavaScript code.

### What is programming problem-solving?

Solving problems is the core of computer science. Programmers must first understand how a human solves a problem, then understand how to translate this "algorithm" into something a computer can do, and finally how to "write" the specific syntax (required by a computer) to get the job done. It is sometimes the case that a machine will solve a problem in a completely different way than a human.

### Expression
Any unit of code that can be evaluated to a value is an expression . Since expressions produce values, they can appear anywhere in a program where JavaScript expects a value such as the arguments of a function invocation.

### Operator

 In JavaScript, an operator is a special symbol used to perform operations on operands (values and variables). For example, 2 + 3; // 5. Here + is an operator that performs addition, and 2 and 3 are operands.

### Function

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).

### JavaScript Function Syntax

* A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().
* Function names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs (same rules as variables).
* The parentheses may include parameter names separated by commas:
(parameter1, parameter2, ...)
* The code to be executed, by the function, is placed inside curly brackets: {}

From <https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_functions.asp> 


*### Function declaration
The function declaration (function statement) defines a function with the specified parameters.

From <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/function> 


### Call

The call() allows for a function/method belonging to one object to be assigned and called for a different object.
call() provides a new value of this to the function/method. With call(), you can write a method once and then inherit it in another object, without having to rewrite the method for the new object.

From <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call> 

### Parameters
Arguments are Passed by Value

* The parameters, in a function call, are the function's arguments.

* JavaScript arguments are passed by value: The function only gets to know the values, not the argument's locations.

* If a function changes an argument's value, it does not change the parameter's original value.

* Changes to arguments are not visible (reflected) outside the function.

From <https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_function_parameters.asp> 


### Arguments

The Arguments Object
JavaScript functions have a built-in object called the arguments object.
The argument object contains an array of the arguments used when the function was called (invoked).
This way you can simply use a function to find (for instance) the highest value in a list of numbers:

From <https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_function_parameters.asp> 


### Return value
Return values are just what they sound like — the values that a function returns when it has completed. You've already met return values a number of times, although you may not have thought about them explicitly.

From <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Building_blocks/Return_values> 

### Refactoring
*Key Term!*
Refactoring—in JavaScript and other languages as well—is the process of changing a piece of code without altering how it works. In other words: you play around with the internal structure of a given function, class, module, etc., without changing the results it produces.

From <https://www.testim.io/blog/javascript-refactoring-5-plays-to-improve-code-quality/> 

The practice of refactoring was popularized by the rise of the agile methodologies. Refactoring is, for instance, an important—and often overlooked—step in the TDD (test-driven development) cycle. Martin Fowler, who literally wrote the book on Refactoring, was one of the authors of the agile manifesto.
