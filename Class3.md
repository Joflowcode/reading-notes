CLass 03 Reading Notes

**Plain language summary per assignment:** 

We learned more about git which is a version control system. In short that means it keeps track of all the changes you make to a file, the time, what was changed, what the originial looked like. It gives a full history of the file's life.

The "Head" is the current most recent version of your file in GIt.

A repository are files that you have told Git to pay attention to. Git is not keeping version control history.
