# Code 102: Class 12 Reading Notes

[The Past, Present, and Future of Local Storage for Web Applications”](http://diveinto.html5doctor.com/storage.html)
***

The past:

* userData (web pages store up to 64kb of data per domain)
* Adobe hada Flash 6 feature called local shared objects
Google had Gears a browser plugin
* and other various APIs or atttempts by companies and groups, all limited

HTML5 changed the game:

To quote the article
> HTML5 storage "is a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally, within the client web browser. Like cookies, this data persists even after you navigate away from the web site, close your browser tab, exit your browser, or what have you. Unlike cookies, this data is never transmitted to the remote web server (unless you go out of your way to send it manually). Unlike all previous attempts at providing persistent local storage, it is implemented natively in web browsers, so it is available even when third-party browser plugins are not.

It works on nearly every browser as well which is an amazing feat.

The rest of the article has made it a nifty bookmark for functions to check JS storage, and which browsers support the other various HTML5 storage methods (such as SQL)

### What I want to learn more about:

I just want to dive in and get hands on practice! All the keys of full stack development are coming together, and I am excited to keep it all building.
