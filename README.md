## Welcome to my Reading Notes

### About Me
My name is Joraya and I am learning full stack development so I can have a good foundation in coding before studying cybersecurity. I live by a few mission statements to guide me in my purpose, values, and goals in life.

A single drop of water contains from thousands to millions of organisms creating a small world. To break it down to the atoms at the molecular level would expand that to an universe in a single dollop of water that splashed on your feet at the beach. A scientist could devote their life's work to studying and understanding all that lives in that drop. So many interesting facts and knowledge to be gained about all the different organisms and atoms.

If one person can spend their lifetime learning about what is in a small drop of water, imagine the endless curiosities of the universe either waiting to be discovered or learned.

Having a growth mindset is critical to be able to keep such things in perspective when I am on a learning journey. It is easy to get swept up in real or perceived failings on our part, comparison or critisimm from others, and the toxic undercurrent in society that pressures people to feel as if they should *already know something they never learned in the first place.*

Growth mindset is the belief that you can study and train to gain knowledge to delevelop a talent. A fixed mindset is more defeatist, and believes you either have it or you don't. No one is perfect, and as a human, even though I thrive on the challenge of learning something new, there are times when doubt creeps in. That is okay. I use that doubt to reinforce my belief that even if I do not learn it all today, or even learn it all, at all, I will continue to put in the effort and enjoy the journey. Life is more fun that way I feel. It is great to be an expert, but imagine if being an expert meant knowing 100% about the subject. Constantly learning and gaining new skills is likely more than half the true joy in attaining the talent.

This bootcamp will be challenging. I'm sure someday I may raise my hand and curse the hardest day and even dream of code. I may get on a good streak and then hit a roadblack that seems inpentrenatable. I may be overcome with doubts and imposter syndrome when I make progress that seems too fast and too good to be true. 

I hope I do not have those moments and I sail through this course with no struggle or pain, or worries. But just in case....just in case I will record here three reminders to reflect back on when I need the boost. Nothing grows without nurturing. We are all at risk of a fixed mind-set without tending to our growth side.

1. Read some inspiring quotes that remind me why I should have a growth mindset, and help foster the joy in keeping it.
> Infinite games have no finish line and the goal is to keep the game going as long as possible - Simon Sinek
2. Read favorite lines of my favorite inspirational or philopophy books.
  - Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, the Hayes modern translation
3. This class has measureable assignments showing progress. If in doubt of my capabilities, and wonder if I could succeed as a black woman in a male dominated industry, look at the progress I made from day one. On day one I struggled with reconciling the differences with markup and html. In weeks time when I am working with JavaScript and more advanced coding, I can look back and go. "You did this. You can do this. You *will* do this."
