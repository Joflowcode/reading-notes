# Welcome To My Code 102 Reading Notes

## About Me
My name is Joraya and I am learning full stack development so I can have a good foundation in coding before studying cybersecurity. I live by a few mission statements to guide me in my purpose, values, and goals in life. My first one is *why not?* when I am encountering an exciting new opportunity, idea, or adventure. It led me to reaching before unimaginable dreams, so with relentless spontaniety, follow-through, and a firm resolution to spread and share in the joy of others, I continue a forever student of the universe and all it contains. One of my favorite things is seeing how all of us see and approach processes differently, and the magic in that there is often no right or wrong especially if it works. I look forward to working and growing and learning with all of you.

I'm the person that gets excited when chaos breaks out or in emergencies. I should have known that IT would eventually loudly sound its alarm. I see clearly now why so many in healthcare make the transition to IT and enjoy it due to its similar fast paced and constantly updating nature.
