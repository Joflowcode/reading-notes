It needs:
* src - tells the browser where to find image
* alt gives text description of image if you can't see it
* title - The name that will show when hover over image

&lt;figure&gt; - it contains images and their captions. You can have more than one image inside the figure, but tehy ned to have th same caption.

&lt;figcation&gt; adds caption to image. Oldber browswers ignore.
