# Class 01 - Learning Markdown - Reading Notes
After going over school policies and introductions, this course wastes no time and immediately dives into learning to code.

Our first introduction required making a repository on Github. In simple terms, a place to store and launch all web pages that are coded in basic syntax language.
There are a lot of website builders today that don't require coding called WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editors. Sights like Wordpress and Wix have
those capabilities. With github, we're going back to the basics. It may not look fancy but the basic syntax of markdown and HTML are the building blocks of becoming a
succesful and good coder.

A few markdown styles that were learned were:
- Creating Headings using the # sign
- How to use **bold** and *italics* 
- There were also handy charts showing the difference between using markdown and html, and gave examples of what it would look like if coded correctly.

This markdown guide is an excellent resource to keep bookmarked until you are confident in remembering the different syntax for formatting. Markdown is considered
easier to read and write than standard HTML, but I found for myself if you have some experience with HTML it can be a bit confusing learning to use a different symbol
for the same result. That can seem discouraging not readily getting something that is considered *easier*. But don't let that stop you, and keep practicing! This is
the foundation, the part where our brains are plastisity is working to build new pathways to learn a new skill. It will not be instant. But what we learn from this intro
class will serve us well our entire career.

Compare it to a celebrated and world renknowed musician. Maybe they find writing the musical notes for their songs too time consuming and tedious after some time.
They may use digital music devices and programs to make composing their work quicker and more efficient. Perhaps they plug their keyboard to a computer and instead 
of having to write the musical notes down themselves, the computer can record and print it for them. 

But they didn't start there. They got a music book and learned to read and write all the musical notes to get a strong knowledge of the very foundation of music. By 
learning to read music they were able to apply that skill to a multitude of instruments not just one. So if the program crashes. Or their software doesn't work or
no longer available, they don't need to rely on a system that does all the work for them. Eventually, it will not be neccessary to write our code in markdown for 
this course. There are smart and intuitive programs that know many programming languages to streamline the work. 

Yet with knowlege of the foundation blocks, it can prepare us to be skilled to learn more complex languages. And just as if the musician has backup, with basic markdown
coding skills, if a program license expires, or an application has difficulty with HTML and other languages, we will always have markdown syntax in our back pocket.

Keeping in theme with the timely message of having a growth mindset from Class 01, I aim to not look at things as "easy" or "difficult". Everything is something 
that needs to be learned, and some things take additional time, research, and resources to learn. But it isn't harder. It just has a deeper well of knowledge to be
uncovered.

Being honest, I thought I was savvy with building websites until today. I've made some on Wordpress and Wix, and even thought I was fancy with HTML and using CSS
styles. I just realized today that I was benefiting from the building blocks of basic coding. I look forward to when it all clicks
but with all things, it is good to not label it as easier or harder. But with enough practice of the code I can see this becoming second nature.
