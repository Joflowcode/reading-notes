# Code 102: Class 2 Reading Notes

## *HTML & CSS* - Jon Duckett

## **Chapter 16: “Images” (pp.406-427)**

Very helpful chapter in learning all the different ways CSS helps in styling images.

Things CSS can do with images (direct book quotes)

* You can specify the dimensions of images using CSS.

* Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically using CSS.

* You can use a background image behind the box
created by any element on a page.

* Background images can appear just once or be
repeated across the background of the box.

* To reduce the number of images your browser has to
load, you can create image sprites.

## **Chapter 19: “Practical Information” (476-492)**

Useful information to know, and the end all for web site development. Things to note:

* Search engine optimization helps visitors find your sites when using search engines.

* Analytics tools such as Google Analytics allow you to see how many people visit your site, how they find it, and what they do when they get there.

* FTP programs allow you to transfer files from your
local computer to your web server

### Things I want to Learn More About:

I want to play around with some images and text to get more practice using all the CSS styling. I want to practice more flex, grid, and different flow methods to come naturally.
