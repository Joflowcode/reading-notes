# Code 102: Class 2 Reading Notes

## *HTML & CSS* - Jon Duckett

## **Chapter 6: “Tables” (pp.126-145)**

Tables is straightforward. The ```<table>``` element used to add tables to web page.


## *JavaScript* - Jon Duckett

### **Chapter 3: “Functions, Methods, and Objects” (pp.106-144)**

You use . notation to access the property or method of an object.

YOu can combine arrays and objects to create complex data structures.

In an object, variables are known as properties of the object; functions are known as methods of the object.

Some built in JS objects are string, number, math, and date.

Biggest takeaway for me is to think of objects representing something real. Like a person is an object and with for name, age, job, etc.

"Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain. An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.

A domain model that's articulated well can verify and validate the understanding of a specific problem among various stakeholders. As a communication tool, it defines a vocabulary that can be used within and between both technical and business teams."

Building an effective domain model requires research, and familarity with subject so you can even know what data you need to collect.
