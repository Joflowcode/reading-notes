# Code 102: Class 6 Reading Notes

## *JavaScript* - Jon Duckett

### **Chapter 3: 3: “Object Literals” (pp.100-105)**

Textbook notes/mostly direct quotes

* "IN AN OBJECT: VARIABLES BECOME
KNOWN AS PROPERTIES
If a variable is part of an object, it is called a
property."

* IN AN OBJECT: FUNCTIONS BECOME
KNOWN AS METHODS
If a function is part of an object, it is called a method. Methods represent tasks that are associated with
the object.

* Like variables and named functions,
properties and methods have a
name and a va lue. In an object,
that name is called a key.

*An object cannot have two keys
with the same name. This is
because keys are used to access
their corresponding values.
The value of a property can be a
st ring, number, Boolean, array, or
even another object. The va lue of a
method is always a function. 

* Web browsers implement objects that represent both
the browser window and the document loaded into the
browser window.

* JavaScript also has several built-in objects such as
String, Number, Math, and Date. Their properties and
methods offer functionality that help you write scripts.
Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data
sets (and both can contain the other).



### **Chapter 5: “Document Object Model” (pp.183-242)** 

> The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies
how browsers should create a model of an HTML
page and how JavaScript can access and update the
contents of a web page while it is in the browser window.

> You will hear people call the DOM an
Application Programming Interface (API).
User interfaces let humans interact with
programs; APls let programs (and scripts)
talk to each other. The DOM states what
your script can "ask the browser about the
current page, and how to tell the browser
to update what is being shown to the user.

> DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes,
element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes.

> You can select element nodes by their id or cl ass
attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax

> In older browsers, implementation of the DOM is
inconsistent (and is a popular reason for using jQuery).

* Most of the content is better viewed in book, as image heavy, and better explained with visual charts and diargrams as book listed.
