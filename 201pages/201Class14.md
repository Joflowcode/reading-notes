## Class 14: CSS

[CSS Transforms](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/css-transforms/)

2D and 3D rotations. Includes the code for CSS and HTML

[Transitions and Animations](https://learn.shayhowe.com/advanced-html-css/transitions-animations/)

Direct quotes that I found useful:
>With CSS3 transitions you have the potential to alter the appearance and behavior of an element whenever a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.

>Animations within CSS3 allow the appearance and behavior of an element to be altered in multiple keyframes. Transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes.

> an element must have a change in state, and different styles must be identified for each state. The easiest way for determining styles for different states is by using the :hover, :focus, :active, and :target pseudo-classes.

> There are four transition related properties in total, including transition-property, transition-duration, transition-timing-function, and transition-delay. Not all of these are required to build a transition, with the first three are the most popular.
