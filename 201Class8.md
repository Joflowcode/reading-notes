> https://web.dev/learn/css/layout/

A webpage saved to favorites as a nice explanation and visuals showing the differences between the CSS stylings.

CSS is highly customizable, and can seem complicated. But some of these methods make it easier to style.

Articles describes flexbox, grid. 
Then the flow layout, with inline block, floats, multicolumns, and positionings.

## **Chapter 15: “Layout” ** (again; repeat of Class 4 reading)

Info from Chapter 4 from Reading Assignment 4. Re-read notes:

Nice overview of what discussed in class as well.

> "CSS treats each HTML element as if in own box. It will be either block-level or inline box"

* Block-level elements start on a new line (h1, p, ul, li)

* Inline elements flow in between surrounding text (img, b, i)

* Containing Elements: If one block-level element sits inside another
block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element.

Some CSS positionings are:

* relative
* static
* absolute
* fixed

Code example best reviewed in book as image heavy, showing possible layouts and the dimmensions needed to create.
